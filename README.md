# tf_test_gpu

This is a simple test script to check that the GPU is operating as expected for Tensorflow. 
The script sets up a matrix defined in the command line arguments and performs a matrix mulitplication and dot product
and outputs the result to screen along with the time and device used to perform the operation.
This script can be run as a sanity check as part of another project.
